;; TODO: make it easier to build a relational (or even non-relational) CESK machine by specifying
;; what forms to include in the source language, and allowing a macro to generate the continuations,
;; apply-kont procedure, and the actual evaluator procedure.  Part of the idea being to make it easy
;; to express the rules of your CESK variant and add and remove clauses without needing to update
;; the code in multple places.
